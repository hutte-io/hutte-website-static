<h2>Company overview</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://flair.hr" target="_blank">flair</a>, a Munich-based ISV founded in 2019, started as an HR solution on the Salesforce AppExchange. Coming from a background in web development, flair's founders chose Salesforce as their business platform to <b>optimize development and DevOps</b> resources \u2013 including hosting and release infrastructure.
</p>
<p>Having worked in various industries, their founders recognized the significance of prioritizing the employee journey alongside the customer experience. Leveraging Salesforce's robust framework, they crafted an innovative and secure HR platform. </p>
<div class="Callout Callout--grey"><div class="Callout-icon">\u{1F440}</div><div class="Callout-text">Today, flair's vision revolves around simplifying and <b>fostering collaboration in HR</b> tasks, catering to evolving workplace needs.</div></div>
<h2>Choosing Salesforce for building an HR platform</h2>
<p>Salesforce offered flair an all-in-one solution for building enterprise SaaS and seamless integration possibilities with over 7K apps. This enabled their customers to effortlessly connect other business software to their HR platform. </p>
<p>The platform\u2019s no-code automations allow users to tailor the system to their organization\u2019s unique structure easily.</p>
<div class="Callout Callout--grey"><div class="Callout-icon">\u{1F4C2}</div><div class="Callout-text">Furthermore, using Git as a single source of truth enabled flair to maintain a <b>consistent track record</b> of all product code changes \u2013 including metadata \u2013 such as data models and declarative business logic.</div></div>
<h2>The challenge: Shipping the product efficiently as a joint effort of coders and no-coders</h2>
<p>flair had a team of Developers and Salesforce Administrators working together. 
The Administrators implemented a wide array of changes, but integrating them into the codebase and packaging them for user delivery proved challenging.</p>
<p>They needed a <b>tool to streamline</b> the process of managing development environments (Scratch Orgs), while also enabling barrier-free low-code and pro-code work between Admins and Developers via Git.</p>
<h2>The solution: Hutte</h2>
<p>Hutte emerged as the ideal solution to address flair\u2019s challenges. It allowed the entire team to move changes through the complete development process efficiently \u2013 from Scratch Org to AppExchange package. </p>
<p>Even Product Managers, Designers, or Reviewers can easily access environments provisioned by Hutte to see the changes in action, enabling smooth collaboration. </p>
<div class="Callout Callout--grey"><div class="Callout-icon">\u{1F3CA}\u200D\u2642\uFE0F</div><div class="Callout-text">flair significantly benefited from Hutte\u2019s pool of Scratch Orgs, <b>eliminating the wait time</b> for sending metadata from Git to newly built Scratch Orgs.</div></div>

<p>\u201CYou can save at least 30 or 40 minutes of pushing metadata with Hutte. You probably create 5 to 7 Scratch Orgs a week as a Developer. As Hutte already has a Scratch Org pool, you can save 5 hours a week.\u201D</p>
