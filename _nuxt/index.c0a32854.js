          <p>When you sign up for a free trial, you get access to all of Hutte\u2019s features for 30 days. You can add as many users as you want and create as many projects as you like. After 30 days, you will be asked to enter your credit card details to continue using Hutte\u2019s full functionality. If you decide not to upgrade, you will no longer be able to use the full functionality and will be reverted to our free plan. None of your projects or data will be lost.</p>

          <p>Setting up Hutte is easy. We provide a step-by-step guide to help you get started. Also, we are happy to help you out from the support chat built into our product in case you have questions. That said, finding your perfect DevOps or CI/CD setup and processes can be a challenging and iterative process. We have a great network of some of the best Salesforce DevOps experts in the world.

          <p>Yes. We take security very seriously. With Hutte sitting between your Salesforce Org and your Git host, we mainly store Authentication Tokens, transactional data, and data that is required inside Hutte (for example, information about your Hutte projects). We use industry-standard encryption and security practices to ensure your Authentication Tokens are safe. This  includes encryption at rest and at application level using 256-bits keys and random initialization vectors. We are SOC 2 Type 2 certified.</p>
