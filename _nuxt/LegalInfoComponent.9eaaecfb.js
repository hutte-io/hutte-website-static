An adjustment shall take effect on the date specified by the Provider, but no earlier than one month after the Customer receives notification of the adjustment. The Customer&#39;s ordinary right of termination in accordance with Section 6 shall remain unaffected. The Provider is also entitled and, in the event of changes in favor of the Customer, obliged to adjust the fees if and insofar as the statutory value added tax changes or taxes are introduced that relate to the Service and affect the Provider.</span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.y0gxqo2qucjo" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c1" data-v-e20be96c>6.

The Provider is entitled to terminate without notice in particular if the Customer fails to make payments due despite a reminder and the setting of a grace period or violates the contractual provisions on the use of the Software under this Agreement. In any case, termination without notice requires that the Customer has been warned in text form (e.g. e-mail) and requested to remedy the (alleged) reason for termination without notice within a reasonable period of time. To clarify: The Customer&#39;s obligation to pay the agreed fee continues to exist even in the event of extraordinary termination without notice by the Provider.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>6.5. These GTC shall also apply to the provision of Services to (also indirectly) affiliated companies and shareholders of the Customer (the &quot;Affiliate(s)&quot;), insofar as these affiliated companies come into contact with the Provider&#39;s Services as intended and the Provider has declared its consent. </span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>6.6. Termination of separately concluded Individual Contracts between the parties does not lead to automatic termination of this contract. However, the termination of this contract shall lead to the automatic termination of any Individual Contracts.</span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.7tjsxcymd2sa" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c1" data-v-e20be96c>7.

The Provider has also taken suitable precautions against data loss and makes daily backups for this purpose. The Provider&#39;s system checks the Customer&#39;s data for viruses. In addition, a state-of-the-art firewall is installed.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>7.3. The Provider shall eliminate any software errors that occur without delay, insofar as this is technically possible. A software error exists if the Software delivers faulty results or does not work properly in any other way, so that the use of the Software is impossible or restricted. The Provider shall be grateful to receive suggestions and proposals regarding the Software at any time and shall take these into account in the further development of the Software.</span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.9e3pydj442rk" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c6" data-v-e20be96c>8.

The Provider acts as the controller within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR with regard to the processing of the personal data of the Customer&#39;s Contractual Partners, insofar as the Customer&#39;s Contractual Partners store data in their own accounts, irrespective of its use in the Customer&#39;s workflows, and have expressly consented to the data processing.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>8.1.3.

The Provider is liable without limitation for damages caused intentionally or through gross negligence.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>11.2. In the event of a negligent breach of a contractual obligation, the breach of which jeopardizes the achievement of the purpose of the contract or the fulfilment of which makes the proper execution of the contract possible in the first place and on the observance of which the Customer may therefore rely (so-called cardinal obligation), the liability of the Provider is limited to the damage foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract and typical for the contract. The parties agree that the foreseeable damage typical for the contract in the event of a breach of a cardinal obligation (i) shall not exceed the amount of 1/4 of the annually agreed fees per claim and (ii) shall not exceed the amount of the total amount of the annually agreed fees for the total number of claims to be expected within one year. The Provider is not liable for negligent breach of a contractual obligation that is not a cardinal obligation.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>11.3. The Provider is not responsible for damages resulting from technical malfunctions or unauthorized access by third parties, unless these were caused intentionally or through gross negligence by the Provider, its legal representatives or employees.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>11.4.

The Receiving Party shall refrain from obtaining confidential information through reverse engineering of goods, products or Services containing confidential information.

The Provider is entitled to draw attention to the fact of the contractual relationship between the Parties, the essential subject matter of the contract and the role of the Provider in public form (e.g. for the purpose of pitches etc.), provided that these facts are not recognizably confidential. All public communication and marketing must be agreed in writing in advance.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>12.7.

The Provider has the right to amend these GTC at any time or to amend regulations for the use of newly introduced additional Services or functions of the Software or Services. Amendments and supplements to these GTC shall be notified to the Customer by e-mail to the e-mail address provided at least four weeks before the planned entry into force of the amendments. The Customer shall be deemed to have consented to the amendment of the GTC if the Customer does not object to the amendment in text form within a period of two weeks, beginning on the day following the announcement of the amendment. The announcement must refer to the amendment, the possibility of objection, the objection period, the text form requirement and the result of the objection.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>13.2. The Provider reserves the right to change the Software and/or Services in order to offer different functionalities, unless the changes or deviations are unreasonable for the Customer. If the provision of a modified version of the Software or a change in the functionality of the Software is accompanied by significant changes to the Customer&#39;s work processes supported by the Software and/or restrictions in the usability of the data generated to date, the Provider shall notify the Customer of this in text form no later than four weeks before the date on which such a change comes into effect. If the Customer does not object to the change in text form within a period of two weeks after receipt of the notification of change, the change shall become part of the contract. The notification of change shall refer to the change, the possibility of objection, the objection period, the text form requirement and the result of the objection.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c0" data-v-e20be96c>13.3. Furthermore, the Provider reserves the right to change the Software and/or the Services in order to offer different functionalities (i) insofar as this is necessary to bring the Services offered by the Provider into compliance with the (case) law applicable to these Services, in particular if the legal situation changes; (ii) insofar as the Provider complies with a court or official decision addressed to the Provider; (iii) insofar as this is necessary to eliminate security gaps in the Software; (iv) due to significant changes to the Services or contractual conditions of third-party providers or subcontractors or (v) insofar as this is predominantly advantageous for the Customer. In particular, the Provider reserves the right to restrict or discontinue the provision of additional functionalities or integrations if the technical partners for these additional functionalities or the providers of the partner integrations significantly change or restrict their Services or contractual terms and conditions and the Provider can therefore no longer be reasonably expected to continue providing them, e.g. because the additional expense incurred by the Provider is disproportionately high. In the case of an annual contract period, the Customer shall receive an appropriate pro rata refund of the fees paid in advance, provided that the additional functionality or integration was invoiced separately.</span></p><p class="c3" data-v-e20be96c><span class="c4" data-v-e20be96c>13.4.
